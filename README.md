Molgenis-EMF
===========

Tools for converting [Molgenis](http://molgenis.org) models to UML/Ecore XMI and back using the [EMF framework](https://www.eclipse.org/modeling/emf/). Conversion between the Ecore and UML is done using the utility method available in EMF. Only modelling details available in the Ecore language are used.

## MolgenisToUML/Ecore
### Notes
- Molgenis internals (e.g. __Type attribute) should be removed
- Many-to-many relationships are implemented without intermediating class
- All one-to-many associations are directional. Many-to-many relationships are bi-directional leading to two associations in Ecore.
- Role name in associations is taken from the field's label. In the many-to-many case, the role name of opposite association is derived from  getMrefLocalid and label. 
- Models can be visualized using e.g. [EMF to Graphviz](http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/emf-graphviz-emf2gv) and [TextUML](http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/textuml-toolkit) Eclipse add-ons.
